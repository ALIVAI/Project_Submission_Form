# Project_Submission_Form
GitHub Project Submission Form
How to Use This Form: 
Fill out the details: Enter your project's name, description, and optional URLs. 
Select files (for reference): You can select local files, but remember they are not uploaded to GitHub through this form. This input is merely to show what files you intend to upload.
Click "Submit Project Details": The form data will be logged to your browser's console (you can open it by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect" -> "Console" in most browsers).
Read the instructions: A blue box will appear with clear steps and example Git commands on how to manually create a new repository on GitHub and push your local project files to it using your terminal.
This setup helps you organize your project information and understand the necessary next steps for publishing your work on GitHub.
All the job is done
